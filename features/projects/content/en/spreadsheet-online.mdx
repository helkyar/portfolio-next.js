This project offers a lightweight and accessible tool for online data
management, allowing users to access their spreadsheets from any device with an
internet connection. Based on React with Typescript, Vitest for testing, and
Sonner for dynamic messages, it has improved my web development skills and
allowed me to explore architectures and design patterns.

## Technologies

- React with Typescript
- Vitest for testing
- Sonner for toast messages

## Features

- **File Management**: Upload and Download sheets
- **Muse and Keyboard Selection**: Select columns, rows and cells area for
  edition, deletion, drag and drop or clipboard management
- **Custom Contextual Menu**: To manage clipboard and matrix edition
- **Create References**: Reference cells and detect cyclic references
- **Dynamic Matrix Edition**: Add and delete columns and rows actualizing any
  existing cell reference references
- **Full keyboard accessibility**
- **Responsive**

## Installation

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository and install the
dependencies:

```bash
git clone
cd spreadsheet
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server will start at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Known Issues

Currently, area selection with the mouse is not supported in Firefox. The same
functionality can be achieved with the keyboard or by clicking both mouse
buttons at the same time.

## Future Improvements

There is no end when creating a fully functional spreadsheet...

- **More features**: One of the most interesting ones to explore are referencing
  cells from other sheets as well as allowing for cell styles personalization
  (color, font, format, ...). Cell resize and cell combination, select multiple
  columns or rows and allow to drag and insert them with preview animation, undo
  nad redo...
- **More dynamic features**: Allowing to insert images and generate graphics
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrating more sophisticated analytics to better
  understand user behavior and engagement with the content.

## Conclusion

Building this project has been an enriching experience that allowed me to take a
deep dive in matrix data management. The use of principles like SOLID and DRY in
conjunction with some patterns has enabled me to create a platform that is not
only functional but also scalable and easy to maintain. As I continue to grow
and evolve as a developer, I look forward to enhancing this site.
